# Giftastic

Welcome to my giftastic website! This site uses the giphy API to generate 10 giphys on the page when you click any of the movie buttons at the top. You can also add movies if you type in the box and hit submit!

All the buttons and any ones added in the future will be dynamically placed accroos the top of the screen. In addition to this, the gifs that are created also have some interactivity. They are displayed initially in a "paused" state. Clicking them turns them to an active state and clicking again re-pauses them.
